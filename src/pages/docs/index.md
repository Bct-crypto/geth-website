## Welcome to go-ethereum

Go-ethereum (aka Geth) is anEthereum client built in Golang. It is one of the original and most popular Ethereum clients.
These documentation pages are intended to help users download, install and use Geth.


## Where to go from here

First, [download](/pages/downloads) and [install](/pages/docs/getting-started/installing-geth.md) Geth.

If you are just starting out with Geth, head to the [Getting started](src/pages/docs/getting-started/getting-started.md) page. That page guides a new user through some basic functions of Geth such as creating and securing accounts and making a transaction using Geth's built-in account tools.

A more secure but slightly more complicated setup is to use an external signer instead of Geth's built-in account manager. We have a [getting started](src/pages/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-clef.md) guide for that too.

Then, it is recommended to read the material in the [Fundamentals](src/pages/docs/fundamentals) section - these pages will help build a foundational understanding of how Geth works from a user perspective and under the hood.

More advanced topics are also available - explore using the sidebar!

## Developers and contributors

If you want to help develop Geth or build decentralized apps on top of it, head to our [Developers](src/pages/docs/developers) documentation.

## More resources

We have a library of videos and articles on our [Resources](/pages/docs/resources.md) page and answers to common questions on the [FAQs](/pages/docs/faq.md) page.
