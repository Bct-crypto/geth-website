## What is Geth?

Geth (go-ethereum) is a [Go](https://go.dev/) implementation of [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) - a gateway into the decentralized web.

Geth has been a core part of Etheruem since the very beginning. Geth was one of the original Ethereum implementations making it the most battle-hardened and tested client.

Geth is an Ethereum _execution client_ meaning it handles transactions, deployment and execution of smart contracts and contains an embedded computer known as the _Ethereum Virtual Machine_.

Running Geth alongside a consensus client turns a computer into an Ethereum node.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. It is the base of a new, decentralized internet.

Read more on our [Ethereum page](/ethereum) or on [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org).

## Why run a node?

Running your own node enables you to use Ethereum in a truly private, self-sufficient and trustless manner. You don't need to trust information you receive because you can verify the data yourself using your Geth instance.

**"Don't trust, verify"**
